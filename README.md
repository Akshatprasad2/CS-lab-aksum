# CS-lab-aksum
We will develop all lab code here


Upload rule:
  Name the file as lab_"lab_number".py

  Name the graph as ana_"no.".png { note: this should be done in lab's respective directory, and hence lab no. need not be included }
  
  {Also if we have error graph or anything else, use err_"q no.".png ... etc}
  
Use brain while using the repo !
